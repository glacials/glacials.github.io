I'm majoring in Computer Science, and I'm a gamer in my free time. I dislike not only long walks and beaches, but also situations in which the former takes place on the latter.\r\n\r\n*Things I'm very experienced at* include PHP, HTML/CSS, Linux, and correcting your written English (but I admit that last one is sometimes more obsession than skill).\r\n\r\n*Things I'm pretty good at* include Java, C/C++, and relational databases.\r\n\r\n*Things I'm okay at* include web design, Python, and coming up with lists of things I'm okay at.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://csuchico.edu/","google":"UA-2876079-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
