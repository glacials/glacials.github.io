I'm 23 years old and I'm a departing Computer Science student at [California State University, Chico][1]. I'm a gamer in my free time. I dislike not only long walks and beaches, but also situations in which the former takes place on the latter. My working environment of choice is a command line.\r\n\r\n*Things I'm very experienced at* include PHP, HTML/CSS, Linux stuff, and correcting your written English (but I admit that last one is sometimes more obsession than skill).\r\n\r\n*Things I'm pretty good at* include Ruby on Rails, Java, C/C++, and relational databases.\r\n\r\n*Things I'm okay at* include web design, Python, and coming up with lists of things I'm okay at.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.csuchico.edu/","google":"UA-2876079-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
